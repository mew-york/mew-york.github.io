# Music Enterprise Works York

Music Enterprise Works York (pronounced "mew York") is responsible for launching and hosting two commercial projects that have grown out of research conducted by the Music Computing and Psychology Lab in the Department of Music at University of York:

* Discover Music
* Unmix+

This site also links to code repositories that may be of interest to people looking to get into music/audio programming. These repos have been developed via meetings of the Music Coding Collective in the Department of Music at University of York.
